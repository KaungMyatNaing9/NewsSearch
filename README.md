# Search

## Abstract
This project develops a text search system using Flask, integrating web crawling, data indexing, and query processing capabilities. The objective is to provide a robust and efficient search tool for Wikipedia articles. The next steps involve implementing advanced text processing features, enhancing the user interface, and optimizing the system for scalability and security.

## Overview
The Flask-Based Wikipedia Text Search System leverages the power of Scrapy for dynamic web crawling, Scikit-Learn for advanced text processing, and Flask to manage web interactions, aiming to provide an efficient search platform. This project addresses the challenge of quickly accessing updated and relevant information from Wikipedia's vast repository. By integrating a custom crawler with a TF-IDF indexer, the system ensures real-time data accuracy and relevancy, enhancing user experience through a responsive search interface. This solution is designed to serve as a scalable model for real-time information retrieval, showcasing a practical application of machine learning techniques in processing and delivering structured information from unstructured data sources like Wikipedia.
