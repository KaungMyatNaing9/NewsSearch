# Search

## Abstract
This project aimed to develop a Flask-based web application that enables efficient searching through a corpus using TF-IDF scoring and cosine similarity. The objectives were to provide a simple yet effective search interface and return relevant search results quickly and accurately. The next steps involve implementing advanced text processing features, enhancing the user interface, and optimizing the system for scalability and security.
